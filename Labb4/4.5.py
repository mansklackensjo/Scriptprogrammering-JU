# Create a program that asks the user to enter a path to a directory on the file system. 
# Your program should then check if that directory only contains files with the following names:

#     config.xml
#     backup-config-YYYY-MM-DD.xml

# There may exists several files with the name backup-config-YYYY-MM-DD.xml, and YYYY-MM-DD should of 
# course be a date for when the backup of the config.xml was created (e.g. 2018-11-12). 
# Your program should print text telling the user if all the files were named in one of these two 
# formats, or if there exist files that doesn't follow these formats (in which case you should
# print the name of these files that don't follow the formats).
